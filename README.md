Why did I make this? 
Hell if I know.
<br>
Is it good?
Heck no.
<br>
The architecture is just so random...
<br>
Then why is it on the front page of my GitHub, and why did I choose to upload this one out of all the projects I've done?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Why do we bake cookies and cook bacon, that's, one of the great mysteries of the universe.
<br>
I mean, to be fair, I deleted most of my projects soon after having created them 'caus I thought they wouldn't serve any purpose anymore, but somehow, this one survived, so enjoy ^^
